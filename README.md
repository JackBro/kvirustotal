KVirusTotal is an online-based anti-virus and anti-phishing tool. It allows you to submit files that will be analyzed by more than 40 up-to-date anti-virus systems. This tool will also enable you to submit URLs that will then be tested against the principal 
anti-phishing systems. Since version 0.21.0, remote files can be downloaded and submitted for scanning too.
